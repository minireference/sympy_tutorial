\begin{abstract}
Most people consider math and physics to be scary beasts from which it is best to keep one's distance.
Computers, however, can help us tame the complexity and tedious arithmetic manipulations associated with these subjects.
Indeed, math and physics are much more approachable once you have the power of computers on your side.
%
%Understand math and physics 

This tutorial serves a dual purpose.
On one hand, it serves as a review of the fundamental concepts of mathematics for computer-literate people.
%who may have forgotten their math or never quite learned it detail.
On the other hand, this tutorial serves to demonstrate to students how a computer algebra system 
can help them with their classwork.
A word of warning is in order.
Please don't use \texttt{SymPy} to avoid the suffering associated with your homework!
Teachers assign homework problems to you
%not because they want you to suffer but 
because they want you to learn.
Do your homework by hand,
but if you want, you can check your answers using \texttt{SymPy}.
Better yet, use \texttt{SymPy} to invent extra practice problems for yourself.
%
%Let's get started!

%The whole point of homework is for you to suffer.
%Mathematical skill is developed through mathematical suffering---only 
%when trying to solve a problem that you haven't solved before will you 
%be forced to think and practice your skills.
%Do not use \texttt{SymPy} to cheat on your homework! 
%You can use \texttt{SymPy} to check your answers though.
%In fact, one of the best ways to learn math is to 
% solve them by hand, and then check your answers using \texttt{sympy}.

%Let's kick some mathematical ass!

\section*{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

I would like to conclude with some words of caution about the overuse of computers.
Computer technology is very powerful and is everywhere around us,
but let's not forget that computers are actually very dumb:
computers are mere calculators and they depend on your knowledge to direct them.
It's important that you learn how to do complicated math by hand in order to be 
able to instruct computers to do math for you and to check the results of your computer calculations.
I don't want you to use the tricks you learned in this tutorial to avoid math problems from now on
and simply rely blindly on \texttt{SymPy} for all your math needs.
I want both you and the computer to become math powerhouses!
The computer will help you with tedious calculations (they're good at that)
and you'll help the computer by guiding it when it gets  stuck (humans are good at that).

The examples and math explanations in this tutorial are sourced from the 
{\sc no bullshit guide} series of books published by Minireference~Co.
We publish textbooks that make math and physics accessible and affordable for everyone.
If you're interested in %relearning you high school math and 
learning more about the math, physics, and calculus topics discussed in this tutorial,
check out the \textbf{No bullshit guide to math and physics}.
%As the book's author,
%I'm somewhat biased so I can't give you an objective review.
The book contains the distilled information that normally comes in two first-year university books:
the introductory physics book (1000+ pages) and the first-year calculus book (1000+ pages).
Would you believe me if I told you that you can learn the 
same material from a single book that is \texttt{1/7}\textsuperscript{th} the size and \texttt{1/10}\textsuperscript{th} of the 
price of mainstream textbooks?

% It's not a scam, it's just the free market doing its thing. 
% Until now mainstream publishers pushed their products to the captive audience of students.
% With eBooks and print-on-demand technology, random Ph.D.'s like me can write books
% Which book do you trust more? The one written by committee or the one written by a human?

%The fundamental tenet of the Minireference Co. publishing company is the utmost respect for the reader,

    This book contains short lessons on math and physics,
    written in a style that is jargon-free and to the point.
    %
    %    The main focus of the book is to show the intricate connections between the concepts of mechanics and calculus.
    %
    Often calculus and mechanics are taught as separate subjects.
    It shouldn't be like that.
    If you learn calculus without mechanics, it will be boring.
    If you learn mechanics without calculus, you won't truly understand what is going on.
    %
    This textbook covers both subjects in an integrated manner.
	%     highlighting the connections between the subjects.
    
Contents:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\sc high school math}%: (40pp) %Review of algebra, functions and trigonometry.
  \item {\sc vectors}%: (20pp) 
  \item {\sc mechanics} 
  \item {\sc differential calculus}%: (30pp)
  \item {\sc integral calculus}%: (20pp)
  \item 250+ practice problems %: (20pp)
%  \item {\sc linear algebra}%: (60pp)

	%Save yourself some time: instead of reading three books you can read just one.
	%The print version will be available December 1$^{\text{st}}$. 
	%Get in touch with me by email if you want to buy a copy of the book in print or as a PDF.

	%I will also appreciate it if you send me feedback and comments.

	%Don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any questions or feedback: 
	%. I would also like to hear what you feedback
	%do you like the style of writing?

	%in which all the material that you normally taught in first year science is explained in a concise manner.

%
%Also of interest, 

%The coverage of the math and physics topics in this tutorial were not sufficient
%to do justice to the subjects. The goal here is to quickly introduce you to the 
%useful \texttt{SymPy} commands. 
%
%you should consider some of my other tutorials on mechanics
%If you're interested in learning more about calculus and mechanics,
%you should consider the \emph{No bullshit guide to math and physics}---a short textbook like no other.

\noindent
For more information, see the book's website %and find more information on the following website 
at \,  \href{http://minireference.com/}{\texttt{minireference.com}}.

The linear algebra examples presented in Section~\ref{sec:linear_algebra} are 
sourced from the \href{https://gum.co/noBSLA}{\textbf{No bullshit guide to linear algebra}}.
Check out the book if you're taking a linear algebra course of if you're missing the prerequisites 
for learning machine learning, computer graphics, or quantum mechanics.

I'll close on a note for potential readers who suffer from math-phobia.
Both books start with an introductory chapter that reviews all 
high school math concepts needed to make math and physics 
accessible to everyone.
Don't worry, we'll fix this math-phobia thing right up for you;
\textbf{when you've got \texttt{SymPy} skills, math fears \emph{you}!}
